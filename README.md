Website that enables the user to play a game similar to geometry dash

## Key Points
• Website that enables the user to play a game.
• The user plays the game alone or against the computer.
• If the user plays against the computer, there are no extra marks for sophisticated artificial intelligence: 
simple random choices are fine.
• The website must be implemented in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
• Zero marks will be awarded for a game that is copied from the Internet.
• Users can register with the website and login. 
• The website has a page that displays the top scores of all registered users.
• User data and scores are stored in JSON format using HTML local storage.
• Cross-browser compatibility is not required – you only need to demonstrate your game on a single 
browser.
• PHP functions are used to output navigation menus, footers, etc.
• You are welcome to use third party libraries, such as jQuery, Bootstrap or a JavaScript game engine. You 
should check with the module leader if a third party library is used for a substantial amount of the 
functionality of your website.
• Marks are available for code quality, game quality and the attractiveness and usability of the website.
• The final submission of your project will only receive a mark if your submission includes a video 
demonstration
